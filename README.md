# BlinkCode: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models🔥

[How Well Can Multimodal LLMs Write Code as Vision-Enabled Agents?](arxiv link)

 <img src="assets/BlinkCode.png" width = "600"  alt="图片名称" align=center />
 
BlinkCode is an innovative benchmark designed to evaluate the coding capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that act as vision-enabled agents. This benchmark consists of 1,000 coding problems, organized into 9 distinct tasks, and is designed to test various abilities including complex reasoning, planning, tool usage, and interactive refinement based on visual information.

## ⚙️Installation

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## 💻Run Evaluation
Please refer to [EVALUATION.md](EVALUATION.md).   

**Important:** Before running the evaluation, please review the [Execution Safety Warning](#🚨execution-safety-warning) below to understand the risks involved and the precautions that should be taken.  


## 🚨Execution Safety Warning
This program is designed to evaluate code generated by multimodal large language models. Running unverified code carries inherent risks. **To mitigate the security risks associated with executing untrusted code, it is strongly recommended to operate this program within a secure and isolated environment.** This may include, but is not limited to, the use of sandboxing technologies, virtual machines, or dedicated testing servers. Such measures ensure that the execution environment is isolated from the main operating environment, thereby protecting the main system from potential malicious code or inadvertent actions.
