# BlinkCode: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models

[How Well Can Multimodal LLMs Write Code as Vision-Enabled Agents?](arxiv link)
 
 <img src="figs/BlinkCode.png" width = "600"  alt="图片名称" align=center />
 
BlinkCode is an innovative benchmark designed to evaluate the coding capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that act as vision-enabled agents. This benchmark consists of 1,000 coding problems, organized into 9 distinct tasks, and is designed to test various abilities including complex reasoning, planning, tool usage, and interactive refinement based on visual information.

#### Visual Reconstruction Tasks:

- Webpage Reconstruction: Screenshots from a diverse collection of websites.
- Scientific Plot Reconstruction: Examples plotted with Matplotlib from its official documentation, selected for diversity in types, styles, and contents.
- SVG Reconstruction: Basic graphics selected from online SVG examples.
- TikZ Figure Reconstruction: Examples selected from the PGF and TikZ examples gallery.

#### Visual Programming Problems:

- Custom Collected Images: For visual programming tasks, specific images were collected from the web, and corresponding special questions were designed such that the problems cannot be solved without observing the visual content of the images.
