You are an expert in data visualization using Python's matplotlib library. The provided image is a screenshot of a figure created using the matplotlib library in Python, and your task is to accurately recreate that figure using matplotlib in Python. You need to ensure that the new figure visually matches the provided image as closely as possible. This includes accurately duplicating the title, axis labels, and legend text; maintaining the style of the axes, the precise positioning of the legend, and the consistency of the line styles; and matching the background color. Additionally, you must precisely restore the relative positions, shapes, and values of the data points to ensure that the data presentation strictly corresponds with the provided image.

def get_odd_collatz(n):
Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence. The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that states that every even number defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
1. Note: 1. Collatz(1) is 1.
2. returned list sorted in increasing order. For example, if we get Collatz(1) returns 1, 3, 5, 8, 11, so the odd numbers are only 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 11.

If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
1. Note: 1. Collatz(1) is 1.
2. returned list sorted in increasing order. For example, if we get Collatz(1) returns 1, 3, 5, 8, 11, so the odd numbers are only 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 11.

def get_odd_collatz(n):
Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence. The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that states that every even number defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
1. Note: 1. Collatz(1) is 1.
2. returned list sorted in increasing order. For example, if we get Collatz(1) returns 1, 3, 5, 8, 11, so the odd numbers are only 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 11.

The code shown above is written to address the problem shown in the image.
However, the code encounters an error: expected an indented block after function definition on line 1 (<string>, line 2)


Your job is to debug the code,  and modify the code to better address the problem depicted in the image, if this is possible.
You must write the revised code, begin with ```python and end with ```. For example:
```python
# Insert your code here
```

The code shown above is written to address the problem shown in the image.
However, the code encounters an error: too many nested parentheses (<string>, line 3)


Your job is to debug the code,  and modify the code to better address the problem depicted in the image, if this is possible.
You must write the revised code, begin with ```python and end with ```. For example:
```python
# Insert your code here

You are an expert in creating graphics using TikZ in LaTeX. The provided image is a screenshot of a graphic created using TikZ, and your task is to accurately recreate that graphic using TikZ code in LaTeX. Ensure that the new graphic visually matches the provided image as closely as possible. Your code should accurately reproduce all visual elements from the image, including geometric shapes, colors, layouts, and text content. Adjust the proportions of the elements, their relative positions, and color settings to ensure the generated graphic faithfully reproduces the original image.
The generated code must include all necessary TikZ commands and parameters to precisely replicate the details and must start with /documentclass and end with /end{document}. If the code relies on specific TikZ libraries or LaTeX packages, import these libraries or packages in the preamble of your document to ensure the code can be successfully compiled. For example, if you use the positioning or shapes.geometric libraries to enhance the layout or shapes of the graphics, import them after /documentclass with commands like /usetikzlibrary{positioning} or /usetikzlibrary{shapes.geometric}.
Write the complete TikZ code.
