When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

All variables, formulas and words with subscripts or superscripts should be shown in latex form wrapped in '$'.\n\n####################OCR result####################\n```\n| Account                          | Busineess U            | Year | Scenar              | Jan            | Feb            | Mar            | Apr            | May            | Jun            | Jul            |\n| --------                         | -------------          | ------| ---------------     | ------         | ------         | ------         | ------         | ------         | ------         | ------         |\n| 215 Consulting Expense           | Hardware               | 2019  | Actuals             | ($2,111,557)   | ($1,412,954)   | ($1,291,124)   | ($1,397,498)   | ($1,565,368)   | ($1,326,379)   | ($1,622,439)   |\n| 216 Software/Hardware Expense    | Hardware               | 2019  | Actuals             | ($2,621,552)   | ($2,216,152)   | ($2,005,552)   | ($2,208,062)   | ($2,194,136)   | ($1,668,852)   | ($2,568,108)   |\n| 217 Marketing Expense            | Hardware               | 2019  | Actuals             | ($803,681)     | ($503,961)     | ($633,831)     | ($642,450)     | ($677,962)     | ($593,836)     | ($885,482)     |\n| 218 Sales                        | Software               | 2020  | Actuals             | $71,093,649    | $69,761,443    | $67,749,499    | $83,659,411    | $50,706,828    | $74,230,386    | $51,880,322    |\n| 219 Cost of Goods Sold           | Software               | 2020  | Actuals             | ($34,103,526)  | ($30,206,863)  | ($27,470,575)  | ($34,682,066)  | ($21,826,243)  | ($32,436,605)  | ($23,222,326)  |\n| 220 Commissions Expense          | Software               | 2020  | Actuals             | ($3,016,900)   | ($2,879,226)   | ($2,741,416)   | ($3,706,047)   | ($5,172,178)   | ($3,904,360)   | ($6,294,449)   |\n| 221 Payroll Expense              | Software               | 2020  | Actuals             | $8,603,051     | $8,541,760     | $7,322,344     | $9,801,852     | $5,175,460     | $9,241,029     | $8,266,209     |\n| 222 Travel & Entertainment Expense| Software              | 2020  | Actuals             | ($796,316)     | ($740,890)     | ($771,325)     | ($1,023,766)   | ($537,167)     | ($1,164,893)   | ($627,016)     |\n| 223 R&D Expense                  | Software               | 2020  | Actuals             | ($3,002,990)   | ($3,340,409)   | ($3,004,524)   | ($3,551,194)   | ($2,323,361)   | ($3,371,500)   | ($2,592,146)   |\n| 224 Consulting Expense           | Software               | 2020  | Actuals             | ($4,083,940)   | ($4,181,857)   | ($4,500,334)   | ($4,808,754)   | ($4,180,160)   | ($4,363,669)   | ($5,457,365)   |\n| 225 Software/Hardware Expense    | Software               | 2020  | Actuals             | ($5,003,748)   | ($5,653,221)   | ($5,700,743)   | ($5,844,376)   | ($4,156,276)   | ($4,435,423)   | ($4,365,678)   |\n| 226 Marketing Expense            | Software               | 2020  | Actuals             | ($1,468,157)   | ($1,469,241)   | ($1,405,114)   | ($1,822,125)   | ($1,017,225)   | ($1,738,189)   | ($1,610,141)   |\n| 227 Sales                        | Advertising            | 2020  | Actuals             | $19,906,222    | $18,137,975    | $19,647,355    | $25,097,823    | $10,648,319    | $21,526,812    | $14,579,455    |\n| 228 Cost of Goods Sold           | Advertising            | 2020  | Actuals             | ($9,892,107)   | ($9,394,094)   | ($9,903,809)   | ($11,464,349)  | ($6,745,879)   | ($10,643,206)  | ($6,139,938)   |\n| 229 Commissions Expense          | Advertising            | 2020  | Actuals             | ($804,051)     | ($776,771)     | ($889,480)     | ($1,085,447)   | ($45,729)      | ($101,836)     | ($90,840)      |\n| 230 Payroll Expense              | Advertising            | 2020  | Actuals             | ($2,107,365)   | ($2,071,573)   | ($2,428,629)   | ($2,973,881)   | ($1,174,694)   | ($3,093,657)   | ($1,495,435)   |\n| 231 Travel & Entertainment Expense| Advertising           | 2020  | Actuals             | ($211,617)     | ($211,295)     | ($229,589)     | ($270,401)     | ($122,946)     | ($258,829)     | ($176,747)     |\n| 232 R&D Expense                  | Advertising            | 2020  | Actuals             | ($882,849)     | ($828,192)     | ($913,737)     | ($1,198,314)   | ($519,107)     | ($889,744)     | ($625,682)     |\n```\n####################OCR result####################\n\nQuery: What is the average profit for Consulting Expense belonging to software in May, June and July?\n\nIf you think you can answer the question directly or find it difficult to get the right answer using the provided API, then you don't have to use the provided API, but you still need to return your answer in python code!!\n\nAnswer format: Answer the question by completing the following function.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block. The texts are described in the reading form, from the upper-left to the bottom-right.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.

When you use the OCR function, you should first see the result and then design the program, to make sure you understand the structure of the ocr result (for example, observe '\\n' to identify how many lines there are, and which elements are on the same lines).\n- Remember that the ocr results give all texts in the image in raw markdown format showing the original code, without any processing, shown in only one code block.
